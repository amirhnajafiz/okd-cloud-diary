# My-Cloud-Journey

How I learned to work with cloud and deploy my projects.

## Start
I start by installing **OpenShift**.<br />
Built on Red Hat® Enterprise Linux® and Kubernetes, OpenShift Container Platform provides a secure and scalable multi-tenant operating system for today’s enterprise-class applications. It also provides integrated application runtimes and libraries.

You can download _oc_ from this [link](https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/290/ver=4.10/rhel---8/4.10.9/x86_64/product-software).

After you installed _oc_, test it with the following command:
```shell
oc -help
```
